bio: Asmaart (1881-1973) was a Spanish painter and sculptor widely considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He is best known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for his innovative and prolific work in a variety of styles, including Surrealism and Expressionism. Throughout his long and productive career, Picasso created thousands of paintings, drawings, and sculptures, including his iconic painting "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" and his sculpture "Guernica," which was a powerful commentary on the Spanish Civil War. He remains an important figure in the art world and continues to inspire artists and art lovers around the world.
